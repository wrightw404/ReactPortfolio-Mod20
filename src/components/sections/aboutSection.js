		<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> I am William Wright and I currently live in San Diego, I attended Michigan State Univeristy where I studied <a href="http://www.cal.msu.edu/academics/undergraduate/xa">Experience Architecture</a>. My first experiences with web design and development were in high school when I took both web design and computer science classes. Ever since then I was hooked. The ability to help people through web design is something that I think is often overlooked and is something that I want to make a point of in my professional career. You can look at some of my accessibility work in my my <a href="#test">projects section</a>. However, throughout the years I have done a few small UX projects for friends/family and a common question that always came up was "Can you build the site for me aswell?". After a while of being frustrated with using template sites that didn't allow for much customization, let alone UX practices, I decided to learn how to become a fullstack devloper. I am currently enrolled in <a href='https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/coding/'>UCSD's Coding Bootcamp</a>, where I am learning alot about current industry technologies.</p>
